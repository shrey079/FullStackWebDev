    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <h2>This is my journey to becoming a full stack web developer. I will sit down and learn how to code for 4 hours a
        day for 30 days. Since I have exams and stuff like that I might not be able to do this in 30 consecutive days
        but I will try my best.
        Every day I will use everything that I learnt that day to make a simple website. They might not be pretty but at
        least I can use this to developy my skillz.</h2>
